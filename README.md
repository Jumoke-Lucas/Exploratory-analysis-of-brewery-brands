### PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The most common, popular alcoholic beverage consumed by Africans is Beer. Non-acoholic malt drinks are also very common beverages consumed by Africans and are produced in the same way as Beer except that it is not fermented. These brands represents a very substantial percentage of the total revenue generated by breweries. I made this analysis using 5 different Beer brands and 2 different Malt brands that are consumed in West Africa. 
In this project, I carried out a profit analysis, brand analysis and country analysis to know what brand has the highest sale, generated the most profit and what country consumed the most beverage.




### ABOUT THE DATASET
This dataset (*International_Breweries.csv*) contains the data about international brewery brands consumed in 5 Anglophone and Francophone countries in west africa which includes Nigeria, Ghana, Togo, Benin and Senegal between 2017 and 2019.

**The columns contained in the dataset are :**
1. Sales rep
2. Sales ID
3. Emails
4. Brands
5. Countries
6. Region
7. Months
8. Years
9. Quantity
10. Cost
11. Unit price
12. Profit
13. Plant cost

### Analysis Using SQL Queries (*file: sql analysis.sql*).

First, I created a database and a table where i imported the csv file containing the datasets
```
Create database Breweries;

Create Table International_breweries(
Sales_id int,
Sales_rep Varchar (255),
Emails varchar(255),
Brands varchar(255),
Plant_cost decimal(10,2),
Unit_price decimal(10,2),
Quantity decimal(10,2),
Cost decimal(10,2),
Profit decimal(10,2),
Countries varchar (255),
Region varchar(255),
Months varchar(255),
Years int,
Primary key (Sales_id)
);
```
I calculated the profit worth of the breweries inclusive of the anglophone and the francophone territories between 2017 and 2019

```
select sum(Profit) from International_breweries;

```
I also calculated and compared the total profit between these two territories 
```
 
 select sum(profit) AS Anglophone_profit from International_breweries
 where countries IN ('Nigeria','Ghana');
 
 select sum(profit) as Francophone_profit from International_breweries
 where countries in ('Togo','Benin','Senegal');
```
Details of beers consumed in the past three years in Nigeria
```
select brands, sum(quantity) as quantity, sum(profit) as profit
from International_breweries where years in (2017, 2018,2019) and 
countries = 'Nigeria'
group by brands;

```
Favorites malt brand in Anglophone region between 2018 and 2019
```
select brands, sum(quantity) 
from International_breweries where years in (2018,2019)
and countries in ('Ghana','Nigeria') and 
brands in ('Beta Malt','Grand Malt')
group by brands;
```
It is often said that south-south region of Nigeria consumes the most alcohol, so i wrote a query to see what brands they consume and how much of it they consume.
```
select brands, sum(quantity) as quantity_sold
from International_breweries
where region = 'Southsouth' and countries = 'Nigeria'
group by brands
order by sum(quantity)desc;
```
I wrote a query to see how much beer was consumed in total by the countries 

```
Select countries,sum(quantity)as amount_consumed
from International_breweries
where brands in ('Eagle Lager', 'Trophy', 'Hero', 'Budweiser', 'Castle Lite')
group by countries
order by sum(quantity);
```
And also what countries generated the most profit
```
select countries, sum(profit) as highest_profit
from International_breweries
where years = 2019 and months in ('October','November','December')
group by countries
order by sum(profit) desc;

```
