# Exploratory-analysis-of-brewery-brands
Exploratory analysis of brewery brands in Anglophones and Francophone countries in Africa between 2017 and 2019 using sql.

### PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The most common, popular alcoholic beverage consumed by Africans is Beer. Non-acoholic malt drinks are also very common beverages consumed by Africans and are produced in the same way as Beer except that it is not fermented. These brands represents a very substantial percentage of the total revenue of breweries. I made this analysis using 5 different Beer brands and 2 different Malt brands that are consumed in West Africa. 
In this project, I analysed the dataset to determine: 
1. What brands made the highest sales in 5 West african countries within the 3 years.
2. How much profit the breweries made within 3 years
3. What country and brand generated the highest profit
